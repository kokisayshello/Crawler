# Crawler
Web crawler in Java with Selenium/ChromeDriver

How to run the code in your environment

Prerequisites and installation needed:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - You need to have Java installed on your system;
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) -  IDE is a must in order to write, edit and manage your Java code;
I used IntelliJ IDEA, but Eclipse and NetBeans are also an options;
3. Selenium WebDriver - Selenium WebDriver library for Java. Add this library to your Java project using a build automation tool like Maven or Gradle. Add the Selenium WebDriver dependency using Maven in your project's pom.xml file;
4. ChromeDriver - ChromeDriver executable (.exe) file - download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver from the official ChromeDriver website (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and make sure it's in your system's PATH or specify its path in your code;
5. Chrome Browser - Ensure you have Google Chrome installed on your system;
6. Set up a basic Java project in your IDE, create a Java class within the project where you can copy-paste the Java code to start;
